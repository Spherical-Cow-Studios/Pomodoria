	    <p>This document informs Users about the technologies that help this
	    Application to achieve the purposes described below. Such technologies
	    allow the Owner to access and store information (for example by using a
	    Cookie) or use resources (for example by running a script) on a User’s
	    device as they interact with this Application.</p>
	
	    <p>For simplicity, all such technologies are defined as “Trackers”
	    within this document – unless there is a reason to differentiate. For
	    example, while Cookies can be used on both web and mobile browsers, it
	    would be inaccurate to talk about Cookies in the context of mobile apps
	    as they are a browser-based Tracker. For this reason, within this
	    document, the term Cookies is only used where it is specifically meant
	    to indicate that particular type of Tracker.</p>
	
	    <p>Some of the purposes for which Trackers are used may also require the
	    User’s consent. Whenever consent is given, it can be freely withdrawn at
	    any time following the instructions provided in this document.</p>
	
	    <p>This Application uses Trackers managed directly by the Owner
	    (so-called “first-party” Trackers) and Trackers that enable services
	    provided by a third-party (so-called “third-party” Trackers). Unless
	    otherwise specified within this document, third-party providers may
	    access the Trackers managed by them. The validity and expiration periods
	    of Cookies and other similar Trackers may vary depending on the lifetime
	    set by the Owner or the relevant provider. Some of them expire upon
	    termination of the User’s browsing session. In addition to what’s
	    specified in the descriptions within each of the categories below, Users
	    may find more precise and updated information regarding lifetime
	    specification as well as any other relevant information — such as the
	    presence of other Trackers — in the linked privacy policies of the
	    respective third-party providers or by contacting the Owner.</p>

      <h1 id="preference-management">How to manage preferences and provide or
        withdraw consent</h1>
	
	    <p>There are various ways to manage Tracker related preferences and to
	    provide and withdraw consent, where relevant:</p>
	
	    <p>Users can manage preferences related to Trackers from directly within
	    their own device settings, for example, by preventing the use or storage
	    of Trackers.</p>
	
	    <p>Additionally, whenever the use of Trackers is based on consent, Users
	    can provide or withdraw such consent by setting their preferences within
	    the cookie notice or by updating such preferences accordingly via the
	    relevant consent-preferences privacy widget, if available.</p>
	
	    <p>It is also possible, via relevant browser or device features, to
	    delete previously stored Trackers, including those used to remember the
	    User’s initial consent preferences.</p>
	
	    <p>Other Trackers in the browser’s local memory may be cleared by
	    deleting the browsing history.</p>
	
	    <p>With regard to any third-party Trackers, Users can manage their
	    preferences via the related opt-out link (where provided), by using the
	    means indicated in the third party’s privacy policy, or by contacting
	    the third party.</p>
	
	    <h2 id="locating-tracker-settings">Locating Tracker Settings</h2>
	
	    <p>Users can, for example, find information about how to manage Cookies

	    apps by opting out through relevant device settings such as the device
	    advertising settings for mobile devices, or tracking settings in general
	    (Users may open the device settings and look for the relevant
	    setting).</p>
	
	    <h2 id="consequences">Consequences of denying the use of Trackers</h2>
	
	    <p>Users are free to decide whether or not to allow the use of Trackers.
