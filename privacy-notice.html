parties, and we will not be liable for any loss or damage caused by the
use of such third-party websites, services, or applications. The
inclusion of a link towards a third-party website, service, or

Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can
activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no
uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals
has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your
choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is
adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that
practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.

certain rights and obligations regarding your personal information.
</p>

<h4 id="your-rights-with-respect-to-your-personal-data">Your rights with
respect to your personal data</h4>
<p>
<strong><em>Right to request deletion of the data — Request to
delete</em></strong>
</p>

<p>
You can ask for the deletion of your personal information. If you ask
us to delete your personal information, we will respect your request and
delete your personal information, subject to certain exceptions provided
by law, such as (but not limited to) the exercise by another consumer of
his or her right to free speech, our compliance requirements resulting
from a legal obligation, or any processing that may be required to
protect against illegal activities.
</p>

<p>
<strong><em>Right to be informed — Request to know</em></strong>
</p>

<p>
Depending on the circumstances, you have a right to know:
</p>

<ul>
<li>whether we collect and use your personal information;</li>
<li>the categories of personal information that we collect;</li>
<li>the purposes for which the collected personal information is
used;</li>
<li>whether we sell or share personal information to third parties;</li>
<li>the categories of personal information that we sold, shared, or
disclosed for a business purpose;</li>

</ul>
<p>
In accordance with applicable law, we are not obligated to provide or
delete consumer information that is de-identified in response to a
consumer request or to re-identify individual data to verify a consumer
request.
</p>

<p>
<strong><em>Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of a
Consumer’s Privacy Rights</em></strong>

We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your privacy
rights.

<p>
<strong><em>Right to Limit Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal
Information</em></strong>
</p>

<p>
We do not process consumer’s sensitive personal information.
</p>

<p>
<strong><em>Verification process</em></strong>
</p>

<p>
Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to
determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in
our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide
information so that we can match it with information you have previously
provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit,
we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the
information you provide with the information we already have on file, or
we may contact you through a communication method (e.g., phone or email)
that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other
verification methods as the circumstances dictate.
</p>

<p>
We will only use personal information provided in your request to
verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent
possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for
the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity
from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you
provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your
identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete
such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying
you.
</p>

<p>
<strong><em>Other privacy rights</em></strong>
</p>

<ul>
<li>You may object to the processing of your personal information.</li>
<li>You may request correction of your personal data if it is incorrect
or no longer relevant, or ask to restrict the processing of the
information.</li>

CCPA on your behalf. We may deny a request from an authorized agent that
does not submit proof that they have been validly authorized to act on
your behalf in accordance with the CCPA.</li>
